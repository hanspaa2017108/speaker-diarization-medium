1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,880
This is vomit from a kid who.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,400
OD'd on some kind of drug.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,560
Blood test would be better.

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,480
Yeah, I know, but I don't have

5
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,280
time for the legal rigor,

6
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,040
moral. And it would've been out

7
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,400
of its system by then. Come

8
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,840
here. Detective McAvoy said that

9
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,760
the footage from. The CCTV in

10
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,480
the detention center was erased.

11
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,160
Can we go through the Attorney

12
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,120
General and get a court order to

13
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:19,920
search their servers?

14
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,040
Technically, yes, but it would

15
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,560
take months, so practically no.

16
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,480
But I could. Hold on one second.

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Dr. Peterson. I need to discuss

18
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:28,880
your pathology report.
